I’m always looking for fun ways to learn. &nbsp;Over the past decade many new methods for learning have been discovered. &nbsp;Not only is information more quickly available, but there are many great new ways to explore it. &nbsp;Interestingly, while technology has taken off, traditional school learning has stayed much the same. &nbsp;Today I’d like to share one of the projects I’ve been working on: An augmented reality children’s bedtime book.

The idea is that you would have a traditional print book that a child could read and enjoy like normal. &nbsp;Point a smartphone at it and the world becomes alive in a beautiful interactive 3D scene. &nbsp;You could see the child rolling in 3D as if floating above the book. &nbsp;You can interact with it, and even have it read to you. &nbsp;It is a fun new twist on reading that hopefully will encourage kid's to want to read and imagine many worlds they can't see.

Unfortunately 3D modeling is fairly expensive for a single developer like myself. &nbsp;The story is &nbsp;written, the book is &nbsp;illustrated, the code tested, and I currently have a group working on modeling the first page. &nbsp;My plan is to hopefully garnish interest from others who believe this is a fun new way to learn and to run a campaign on Kickstarter.

I'm really hoping this project pans out, all the pieces&nbsp;are in place for it to turn out wonderfully. &nbsp;But more than this project I imagine a really cool future of learning.&nbsp;Imagine text books where the math jumps o&nbsp;ut of the page and comes alive. &nbsp;Or where you can see the anatomy, geography, or astronomy in 3D as you learn about it. &nbsp;It would encourage you to get up and to circle your book, to view learning from a whole new perspective.

Anyway, it is one of the many projects I'm working on. &nbsp;I should be getting 3D models back soon, and I plan to update with more pictures once I do.
