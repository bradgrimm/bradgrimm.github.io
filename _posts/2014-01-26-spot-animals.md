As a kid I loved Where's Waldo. &nbsp;It was the perfect game that never got old. &nbsp;Each page was jam packed with tons of items, and it took hours to find all of them. &nbsp;Where's Waldo and I Spy were the inspiration for my latest app. &nbsp;Today I announce another project I've been working on called Spot! Animals.

It is a seek & find app for young kids where they search&nbsp;for animals at the zoo, ocean, safari and more. &nbsp;It is simplified slightly to make it easier for young kids, but there is still many things to find and plenty of replay value. &nbsp;I've already had Logan come up and tell me over and over 'animals, animals'. &nbsp;It is always good to have happy customers before it has even launched.

This will be the second app that I've contracted nearly all of the work from scratch. &nbsp;That includes paying for all the development, art, and music. &nbsp;This is fun for a couple of reasons. &nbsp;First &nbsp;of all it is a fun and new experience to take a step back as a developer and jump into the manager roll. &nbsp;And second because it is fun to have grown my business to a point where I am able to do that.

On the other hand it is hard at times to let other developers design and write the code. &nbsp;I know it is important let go, but it is hard when I know I'll probably end up putting time into bug fixes and polishing the app after all is said and done. &nbsp;I've also grown a respect for management in general. &nbsp;I'm surprised how much time it take

s to find good talent, give a complete vision, and follow up to make sure everything gets complete.

Anyway, the game will probably be released in February 2014, so wish me luck as I wrap things up.
