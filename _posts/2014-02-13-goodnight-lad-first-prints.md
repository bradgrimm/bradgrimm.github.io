![2014-02-12 (1)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/02/2014-02-12-1.jpg?w=300)The first prints of my book arrived today! &nbsp;They turned out great. &nbsp;The quality is actually higher than I expected and the illustrations look fantastic in print. &nbsp;There are a few minor issues I'll want to fix before pushing out a larger batch, but nothing to dampen my excitement.

Now I am just waiting on the 3D animations. &nbsp;I received a video of them a couple days ago and they look beautiful. &nbsp;It shouldn't be long before it all comes together, look out for my kickstarter campaign that is just around the corner.
