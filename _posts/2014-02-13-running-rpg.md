I wanted to share another active project of mine that I've given the nickname 'Rev'. &nbsp;The idea is to merge the world of running with the world of video games. &nbsp;You see, for me video games were always super compelling. &nbsp;In games you get to assume the role of an interesting character, there are challenges, quick&nbsp;growth, and many mechanics that motivated you do to do better. &nbsp;On the other hand while I love running it is hard to get out the door, hard to keep pushing myself while I'm out there, and the results are slow at best. &nbsp;So I wondered if a game could be built that would be so interesting that I just couldn't keep myself from running. &nbsp;That is project Rev.

From the onset, I've always believed that Rev needed to be treated differently than any other project I've worked on.

**1. Users cannot use traditional inputs (while running). &nbsp;**

Normally users interact through touch. &nbsp;It is a natural simple way of interacting with an app. &nbsp;But this completely breaks down while running. &nbsp;The moment you make them touch their phone on a run, you've lost the magic. &nbsp;It takes away from their run, and can be dangerous.

This essentially leaves audio as the only feedback. &nbsp;We did think of using Google Glass as well as smart watches and other wearable tech. &nbsp;But it is more of an extra, or a fun feature, the major feedback has to be through audio.

So we tested this, and we found that not only is audio important but it is critical. &nbsp;There is a fine line between too much audio blaring in your ear and too little audio driving you further. &nbsp;We found that a robotic voice is slightly frustrating, but since there are lots of numbers being thrown around the robotic voice is important. &nbsp;We've approached this problem by recording as much as we can, but leaving a robotic personal assistant voice that gives stats and other useful information as you run.

**2)&nbsp;The game needs to push you, but it should never encourage you to stop running. &nbsp;**

In a traditional game you give a player a challenge, and if they fail they lose a life and start over. &nbsp;If we followed this traditional pattern then in the middle of a run we'd send a user home! &nbsp;This is definitely not allowed. &nbsp;Yet, on the other side of things we need to challenge them.

We approach this problem by removing the concept of life completely, and put the focus 100% on the enemy. &nbsp;By running faster, you do more damage, and slower you do less damage, but you always do \*some\* damage. &nbsp;This allows us to focus completely on time. &nbsp;It may take you much much longer to finish a level, but you should be able to finish any level no matter how fast you run.

This also makes it easy to provide rewards such as stars for breaking certain times. &nbsp;Best of all we will always encourage you to run, and even if you aren't fast you can pass every single level without a problem.

**3) The game needs to learn from your running habits.**

The last challenge we've faced is making sure that anybody can play the game. &nbsp;In a traditional game you play a character, which means as long as the character is powerful you are powerful too. &nbsp;This doesn't work with running, if you run a 15 minute mile, chances are you won't ever get to the speed of a 6 minute mile runner. &nbsp;But we want to encourage both to run. &nbsp;So we have to learn from each user!

One of the ways we do this is by making all attacks relative to a users average speed. &nbsp;We keep track of their average, max, and min speeds with a weighted average over time. &nbsp;This gives us the freedom to create levels where we can encourage them to run faster than they normally. &nbsp;We can also encourage running fast in intervals which leads us to a nice interval training style of run.

Anyway, Rev is still a long way away from seeing the light of day. &nbsp;But listen back soon, we plan on sponsoring runs and we will need lots of alpha and beta testers to help us out in the end.
