I recently read [this](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2098435/report-finds-ios-apps-riskier-than-android-apps.html)&nbsp;article that states that iOS apps are riskier than Android apps. &nbsp;I make a point of not trusting news articles... &nbsp;I'm an Android developer, so I like hearing Android doing well. &nbsp;And it would be easy to just rejoice that Android is awesome, but instead I decided to look a little deeper.

First, the PCWorld article itself But let's face it, Android @ 83% vs iOS @ 91% hardly makes me feel good. &nbsp;It is akin to saying, all your data is stolen 9 out of 10 times on iOS but only 8 out of 10 times on Android. &nbsp;So... you're telling me all my data is stolen? &nbsp;Great.

Second, what does 'risky' even mean? &nbsp;So I decided to pull down the report and take a look myself. &nbsp;Here were the things they considered risky...

- Location Tracking
- Access Address Book
- Access Calendar
- Single Sign-On (via social network)
- Identify User (UDID)
- In-App Purchases
- Ad Networks

Really? These are the scary 'risky' behavior you are basing things off of? &nbsp;Some I would consider the price of wanting a free app (in-app purchases, ads). &nbsp;While others may be considered features, depending on the app function (location, address, calendar, single sign-on).

My conclusion? &nbsp;More FUD, carry on, there's nothing to see here.
