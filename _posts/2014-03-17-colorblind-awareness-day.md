 **Happy Colorblind Awareness Day!&nbsp;**  
_(Or as the rest of the world likes to call it St. Patrick's Day)_

Twenty plus years ago I woke up on St. Patrick's Day. &nbsp;Excited for a fun holiday, I went to my closet and picked out my favorite bright green t-shirt. &nbsp;I was ready and exited. &nbsp;You see, tradition has it that if somebody doesn't wear green on St. Patty's day you are allowed to pinch them. &nbsp;I was in elementary school, and if I didn't wear green I was likely to end up like a victim in Alfred Hitchcock's _The Birds._

[![ntssadyl]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/03/ntssadyl.jpg?w=300)](http://bradgrimm.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ntssadyl.jpg)I arrived at school and instantly I was pinched... hard! &nbsp;"Wait!", I said, "I'm wearing green, you aren't allowed to pinch me." &nbsp;The girl looked at me funny and asked: "Uh... where?" &nbsp;I excitedly pointed at my&nbsp; **bright green** t-shirt. &nbsp;She laughed at me and ran away.

Child after child they came up pinches, laughed, and ran away. &nbsp;After a few of them I started to realize I had made a dreadful mistake. &nbsp;It was obvious I wasn't wearing green, or at least it was obvious to them.

After a day of being pinched and laughed at, I finally made it home. &nbsp;I said to my mom: "I was pinched all day today, why didn't you tell me I wasn't wearing green?!" &nbsp;She looked at me a little quizzically and responded: "Oh, I thought you were just trying to be a little rebellious."

The next year, I was ready. &nbsp;I asked my mom for help, and the two of us picked out a nice green shirt for St. Patrick's Day. &nbsp;I went to school, and was determined to make up for last year. &nbsp;This year I would be the aggressor, my classmates would feel my pinch! &nbsp;I arrived and noticed somebody without green on. &nbsp;I ran up and said: "I get to pinch you! &nbsp;You aren't wearing green." &nbsp;The boy gave me a strange look, "Yes I am", he said. &nbsp;I responded, "It doesn't count if it is on your underwear." &nbsp;And I reached out and pinched him hard.

Satisfied that I had won this year I strutted into class, only to find my teacher there waiting with her arms crossed, the little boy with a smirk standing next to her. &nbsp;After an explanation that his pants were indeed green. &nbsp;And a firm explanation that pinching is not allowed in school, I was finally sent to my seat. &nbsp;From that day forward, I decided to fight for the disabled. &nbsp;I vowed to hate St. Patrick's Day, and to defend all those who are pinched unaware. &nbsp;Or... at least that's what I tell everyone when, after an hour of staring into my closet debating which one is green, I end up at work wearing a bright yellow shirt.
