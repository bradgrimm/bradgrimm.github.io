After lots of&nbsp;work I am proud to finally announce that my Kickstarter has gone live. &nbsp;I've been super impressed and grateful by the amount of support I've received so far. &nbsp;Please help the good vibes keep rolling by sharing in any way possible.

As the project goes on, I'll be sure to bring updates and information about the process. &nbsp;So check back soon for lots of news and goodies, but in the meantime&nbsp;go back the project!
