Even toddlers can play with a mode that doesn’t require any matching at all. &nbsp;Tap any of the animals and be rewarded with a splash of color and sound. &nbsp;My son loved it, and was the perfect little beta tester to make sure they game is perfect for toddlers, I’m sure your kids will love it too.
