Both the Google Play&nbsp;Store and the Apple App Store were built&nbsp;on the backs of independent developers. &nbsp;The platform was wonderful! &nbsp;People could easily find exactly the apps they were looking for, and developers could finally reach out to niche markets. &nbsp;The pay for developers was reasonable, and the cost for users was much cheaper than traditional software. &nbsp;Life was great.

But not anymore. &nbsp;Let me share a couple experiences...

[![unnamed]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/04/unnamed.png?w=168)](http://bradgrimm.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/unnamed.png)Over two years ago I released my&nbsp;second app to the Play Store, [Funny Voice Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.givewaygames.audiovocoder). &nbsp;My first app, [Palette Painter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.givewaygames.palettepainter), had a really slow launch, after all it&nbsp;only supported Android 3.0 on launch day which had less than 1% of the market (though it supports 2.2+ now, and is still going strong). &nbsp;I expected the same slow response with Funny Voice Changer, so I clicked Publish and went on vacation. &nbsp;Boy was I wrong.

Funny Voice Changer exploded overnight. &nbsp;It was getting thousands of downloads a day. &nbsp;In fact, it was too many. &nbsp;I wasn't ready for the barrage of ratings, the bugs it encountered, and the emotional roller coaster that ensued. &nbsp;I gave up on the app after just a couple of months, something I have regretted ever since.

[![unnamed1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/04/unnamed1.png?w=168)](http://bradgrimm.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/unnamed1.png)I have since learned about the importance of iteration, and finally decided&nbsp;to fix those two apps, and remove that regret from my shoulders. &nbsp;Yesterday, I finally released the refreshed versions, [Funny Voice Changer 2.0](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.givewaygames.changer.funny) and [Scary Voice Changer 2.0](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.givewaygames.changer.scary).

So how is the launch going so far? &nbsp;Try a little experiment for me, go to the play store and search for _Funny Voice Changer_&nbsp;or better yet, use the name exactly _Funny Voice Changer 2.0_. &nbsp;Do you see it? &nbsp;If you don't, that's because it is ranked #124 for the first, and #88 for the second. &nbsp;That's right you can't even find your own apps by name anymore. &nbsp;_Note: You will see my Voice Changers from 2.5 years ago in the 1st and 4th places. &nbsp;You won't find my new voice changers._

> You&nbsp;can't even find your own apps by name anymore.

Perhaps this is a one time thing? &nbsp;(Well two technically, since there are two voice changers) &nbsp;But the same thing happened to me just a couple weeks ago. &nbsp;I released a fun [Hidden Animals](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.givewaygames.spot) game. &nbsp;My son loves it, and I'm certain other kids would as well. &nbsp;But the day of the launch I couldn't find it. &nbsp;Even searching by the exact name it didn't show up at all,&nbsp;not in any page, in any search I tried. &nbsp;I have since tweaked the name and description a bit and have gotten it to show up at about the same 100th place on the search, but&nbsp;not exactly a searchable spot.

So how are they ranking apps via search? &nbsp;Nobody knows. &nbsp;Which is probably for the best, otherwise people would game the system. &nbsp;It is obvious that the title and description don't help as much as they once did. &nbsp;So perhaps there is a variety of good reasons they've done so, right? &nbsp;After all,the goal is to provide people with the best apps possible. &nbsp;So what factors could they be using to rank apps?

Here are a few ideas along with some comments:

**- Ratings.** &nbsp; This actually seems like a fairly reasonable way to organize apps. &nbsp;But I have my doubts that it actually has much of an effect. &nbsp;After all my previous&nbsp;[Funny Voice Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.givewaygames.audiovocoder) is ranked #1 and it has a miserable 3.3 star rating. &nbsp;But worse, even some 1-star apps are showing&nbsp;up higher than my new apps, and these are apps that people obviously don't want.

**- True intent.** &nbsp; A user types in&nbsp;"Funny Voice Changer", but is&nbsp;really interested in any voice recorder out there. &nbsp;This has a grain of salt to it, we don't always know exactly what we are looking for. &nbsp;Though I believe&nbsp;people are generally pretty good at it... but if they are looking for a funny voice changer it doesn't make much sense to show a face changer. &nbsp;That having been said, there are a \*lot\* of voice changers, so I do applaud&nbsp;Google for trying to parse it into something reasonable (assuming the results are reasonable).

**- Number downloads. &nbsp;** Once again it makes sense that if an app is downloaded a lot it must be loved. &nbsp;Though I do argue this should be weighted by how well people \*liked\* the app after they downloaded it. &nbsp;For instance, even though [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.eguchi.android.voicechanger) app has 100,000 - 500,000 downloads, something tells me that if you download it, you won't like it. &nbsp;This method of course helps either apps that have been in the store for a long time (regardless of worth), and developers with large pockets who can advertise to get a lot of downloads quickly.

[![Screen Shot 2014-04-25 at 11.27.47 AM]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-25-at-11-27-47-am.png?w=604)](http://bradgrimm.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-25-at-11-27-47-am.png)

**- App awesomeness.** &nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a great metric, but how do you calculate&nbsp;this? &nbsp;The only way I can think would be how pleasing the screenshots, title, description, ect are. &nbsp;I would love to believe that they're doing crunching on these to calculate an awesome score, but seeing apps like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.eguchi.android.voicechanger) and [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naskit.android.AndRoboiceLite) make me believe they aren't.

**- App life -&nbsp;** I've heard some people say that uninstalls have a huge impact on your ranking. &nbsp;That makes a fair bit of sense, and I hope it is something they are doing. &nbsp;On the other side of things, not all lifecycles are the same. &nbsp;While some apps like Facebook you may keep on for the long haul, there are&nbsp;apps that may be perfect for an occasion. &nbsp;Mine are great for sleepovers, others are great for weddings, and&nbsp;others for travel. &nbsp;But you&nbsp;still should&nbsp;be able to find those apps if you're in the moment.

**- External links/Google magic.** &nbsp;This seems the most reasonable idea. &nbsp;But it also tends to benefit those with large pockets. &nbsp;Do you want lots of reviews of your app? &nbsp;Do you want press releases? &nbsp;Then open up your checkbook, because nothing is free. &nbsp;And that's assuming &nbsp;your SEO efforts even pay off, it is very likely they won't.

I don't know how their ranking algorithm works. &nbsp;But it is clear to me that&nbsp;as an indie developer it is no longer worth&nbsp;it to invest my time into&nbsp;building creative apps for the Play Store.

_I'd love to hear your&nbsp;experiences on deploying to the store. &nbsp;Has it been the same for you?_
