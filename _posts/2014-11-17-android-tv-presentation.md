I recently gave a presentation&nbsp;regarding Android TV for the Google Developers Group in&nbsp;Utah. &nbsp;All in all I am very impressed&nbsp;with Android TV. &nbsp;Google has learned a lot of lessons&nbsp;as they've attempted&nbsp;this with Google TV, Nexus Q, and the Chromecast. &nbsp;This iteration finally gets the experience right.

I also was impressed how easy it was to port existing code to&nbsp;Android TV. &nbsp;I attempted to port HireVue Pro, and it turned out gorgeous and simple to use. &nbsp;I really hope these TV's garner the attention of developers, because it really could&nbsp;finally change the outdated TV experience.

Here's to hoping.

The entire presentation (minus one video which wouldn't upload) can be found [here](http://prezi.com/er-yjz61jr8s/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share).
