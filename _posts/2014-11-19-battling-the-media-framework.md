Earlier this year I gave a presentation titled _Battling the Media Framework_. &nbsp;I've had a lot of bitter-sweet experience dealing with Android's media framework. &nbsp;I've had&nbsp;experience with camera & OpenGL via Goofy Glass, mic & audio with my voice changers, and a healthy amount of video at both Sorenson Communications and currently with HireVue.

The short and skinny of it is: "These API's on Android are super hard". &nbsp;My goal with each of those apps has been to support as many devices as possible with the best experience possible. &nbsp;With over 7000 devices, it hasn't always been easy.

For some practical tips on how to deal with the shortcomings of those API's feel free to check out my slides [here](http://prezi.com/qwgozqjpgk9z/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share).
