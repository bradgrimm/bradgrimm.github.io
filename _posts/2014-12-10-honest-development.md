Through my years of development I have always strived to be an honest developer. I want my users to have a good experience. I want to build fun, new, exciting, polished apps. And I want to play by the rules...

But not everybody plays by the rules.

**Animal Game**

When I released Spot Animals a few months back I was very disappointed that I could not even find my app in the store by name. &nbsp;Or by any other combination of search terms, no matter how much I scrolled down. &nbsp;Trust me, after lots of development, nothing is worse. &nbsp;Here's me searching for it by name.

_Originally called 'Hidden Objects Animals'_

While searching for my app I came across a variety of other apps that were high in the ranks, but seemingly poorly built. I was on a quest to figure out why. &nbsp;Admittedly,&nbsp;many of the apps were generally high quality, and had a lot of downloads to help them keep their high ranking. &nbsp;After searching for a while I came across this app:

Now, I'm not going say whether this app deserves its ranking or not, I didn't download or play it. But as I was scouring their reviews I found a really disconcerting trend. &nbsp;Let's see how fast you can see the trend...

I think I can sum up all the above with "Cute cute cute cute cute". I found page after page of ratings that had exactly the same rating... some number of Cute's and a high 4 or&nbsp;5-star rating.

Now it is possible that there are simply a ton of people that just find this app unbearably cute. &nbsp;But more than likely these were purchased reviews. &nbsp;Almost none of the reviewers have thumbnails, and they all look awfully similar. &nbsp;The chances of this being the case sounds particularly low to me. &nbsp;This really got me wondering... How many apps simply cheat their way to the top?

**Email**

I'm not certain how many apps do this, but I assume it must be a lot. Since my apps are on the store I am&nbsp;required to provide a public facing email that users can contact me at. Sadly, about half of emails I get are advertisements. And of those there are two main categories. The first are advertising networks: &nbsp;_Our ads will make you way more money!_&nbsp;But a close second is: _We'll get you more ratings/downloads._ &nbsp;Here is an example of one such email:

&nbsp;

Now, I'm not sure how well Google is able to crack down on this, but it actually sounds like an incredible difficult thing to do. &nbsp;It is a short step from encouraging 100 of your friends to download your app, to paying a 100 of your friends to download and rate it 5-stars. &nbsp;How does Google distinguish the difference between the two without seeing the money transfer? &nbsp;I'm not really sure they can.

So if I'm receiving this many requests&nbsp;there must merit behind it. &nbsp;Which makes me&nbsp;believe the number of apps using this method of deception isn't small.

**Temptation**

So is it tempting to use this with my apps? &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;There's always that desire boost ones downloads and ratings, who wouldn't want that? &nbsp;And there's always the question of: "If I get the ball rolling, how big could it become?".

But&nbsp;I got into app development because it is fun. &nbsp;And I refuse to let the illusion of grandeur dissuade me from doing what I love, and doing it in a way&nbsp;is honest and true to my values. &nbsp;And of course the fear of getting my apps kicked off the store is always there too.

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone else has&nbsp;seen this kind of trend elsewhere, and what other developers feel about it. &nbsp;Is there anything honest apps can do to combat it?

_Note: Since it has been months since I originally released "Spot!". &nbsp;I wondered how it fares now. &nbsp;The good news is, it is showing up just fine in the rankings, and interestingly enough the other app isn't in that list anymore. &nbsp;Who knows the magic behind the store ranking, but one thing is for sure, just because you have a certain rank (or don't) doesn't guarantee you'll stay there._
