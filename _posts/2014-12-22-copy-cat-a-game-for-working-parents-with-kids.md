Imagine a rough morning where you wake up early to get to work. &nbsp;Your family is still asleep, and you aren’t able to say a proper goodbye before leaving. &nbsp;There’s a big important deadline, and it is taking all of your time and energy. &nbsp;You are finally starting to get things done when the phones rings… &nbsp;it is your child, super sad that they didn’t get to see you. &nbsp;Just then your child starts crying on the phone for you to come back home. &nbsp;You love them, but how do you show them with so much to worry about at work?

One idea to try is the copycat game. &nbsp;It is a fun and simple game that we like to play. &nbsp;Send your kids a picture of yourself making a silly face and ask them to copy it and send a picture back.

It may not seem like much, but it will go a long way for your kids. &nbsp;It helps remind your kids that you haven’t forgotten them, and that you still love them. &nbsp;But it doesn’t take as much time as a phone call or video chat would, and it can be a lifesaver on a busy day.

I find on any given day it doesn’t take more than 6-8 pictures. &nbsp;Part of the fun is the anticipation of what picture is going to come next, so you don’t need to worry about taking more than one an hour. &nbsp;And if too much time goes on before you send a picture, they can always nudge you back by sending their own face to copy.

Give it a try and let me know if your kids love it as much as my boy does.
