      <h2>About Bradley Grimm</h2>

      <div class="about-section">
        <h3>Machine Learning & Clinical Research</h3>
        <p>I lead multimodal machine learning development across video, audio, and language for digital health products and clinical research at Videra Health. My role spans everything from study design and dataset creation to model development, validation, and deployment, with a focus on building systems that work on real-world clinical data.</p>

        <p><strong>Movement, speech, and neurodegenerative disease:</strong> Led development of a production tardive-dyskinesia screening system built from clinician-labeled video, and built validated models for Parkinson's disease, dementia, and a range of movement and voice disorders, including external-dataset validation and longitudinal analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Mental and behavioral health:</strong> Built multimodal and NLP-based models for depression, anxiety, PTSD, postpartum depression, bipolar disorder, substance-use outcomes, and emotional distress, including systems for detecting suicidal and crisis-related language in clinical workflows.</p>

        <p><strong>Clinical language, speech, and interaction:</strong> Developed systems for clinical note generation, key-moment extraction, grade-level and language-complexity scoring, empathy, teach-back, and trust measurement, as well as speaker identification. Designed AI-driven tools that give clinicians feedback on communication quality and patient engagement.</p>

        <p><strong>Audio-first and unsupervised modeling:</strong> Built audio-only and unsupervised models for respiratory disease, vocal pathology, and neurological change, enabling health assessment from speech and sound alone.</p>

        <p>My specialty is machine learning with video. It's where my computer vision background, clinical research experience, and engineering skills all come together.</p>

        <h3>Software Engineering Background</h3>
        <p>I've been writing code for over 20 years, starting as a kid nearly 30 years ago. My engineering background spans backend systems, mobile development, and frontend work. This gives me a double-threat skillset as a data scientist: I can build production systems from the ground up.</p>

        <p>Before Videra Health, I spent nearly 8 years at HireVue. I joined to build Android apps (improved the candidate app from 2.5 to 4.5 stars in 5 months, built the reviewer app end-to-end), then transitioned into data science for about 5 years. On the data science side, I designed, trained, and deployed ML models for NLP, computer vision, and speech recognition. I led innovation work on resume matching and LLM embeddings, and built tools to improve model quality across teams. That gives me close to 10 years of data science experience overall.</p>

        <p>My educational foundation is a BS and MS in Computer Science, with my master's work focused on image analysis. Strong background in computer vision, robotics, and scientific computing. This is why I'm effective at building ML systems that process video and audio in clinical settings.</p>

        <h3>Musical Journey</h3>
        <p>Music is a huge part of who I am. I'm the drummer for <a href="https://grimstonemusic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimstone</a>, a punk/alternative rock band, and I also play guitar, bass, and keys. If you want to know me as a person, you can't do that without getting into my musical head and joining my musical journey.</p>

        <p>I run all the equipment for the band and have learned a ton about music production, sound engineering, and recording. We're building something from scratch, and it's one of the most rewarding things I do. Check out our <a href="https://grimstones.bandcamp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bandcamp</a> to hear what we're working on.</p>

        <h3>Tinkering & Adventures</h3>
        <p>I'm a tinkerer at heart. I've been running a synchronized Christmas light show for over 10 years. I love mountain biking, triathlons, and being active outdoors. I've gone skydiving. I edit videos. I build random things that don't exist yet.</p>

        <p>I chase a lot of ideas. Some stay as experiments, others I push all the way to completion. When I commit to finishing something, I see it through and make it count. I'm the kind of person who'll try anything: skydiving on a birthday, building a Christmas light show from scratch, or starting a band at 40. If it seems interesting or impossible, I'm probably already thinking about how to do it.</p>

        <p>Whether you're looking to hire me, reconnecting with an old friend, or just curious about what I'm up to, there's plenty to explore here. Check out my musical journey with Grimstone, watch some mountain biking videos, or just reach out and say hi.</p>

        <h3>Past Projects</h3>
        <p>Earlier in my career, I built AR children's books and mobile apps that collectively reached millions of downloads. While most of these projects are no longer active, they represent important learning experiences in product development, user engagement, and building things people love.</p>

        <p><strong>Augmented Reality Books:</strong> Created <em>Goodnight Lad</em> and <em>Marvelous Machines for Silly Things</em>, two AR children's books that brought stories to life through 3D animations. Both were successfully funded through Kickstarter campaigns. (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hiddenworlds/goodnight-lad-augmented-reality-childrens-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodnight Lad Kickstarter</a>, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hiddenworlds/marvelous-machines-for-silly-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvelous Machines Kickstarter</a>)</p>

        <p><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Built multiple Android apps including a voice changer and face morpher that became hugely popular, reaching millions of downloads. These projects taught me valuable lessons about building production systems and understanding what users actually want.</p>
